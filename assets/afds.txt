Issued at 1026 PM EDT Thu May 25 2023

Much better potential exists tonight than last night for
widespread min temps in the mid/upr 30s. Those were localized
last night and lower 40s min temps were more the rule. There is
less cloudiness tonight and the winds are lighter, with a better
chance of the wind going near calm in several areas. The clouds
currently dropping in from the north are mainly thin and appear to
be aimed more into Upr MI and WI than into Lwr MI. Frost/Freeze
headlines continue.

.DISCUSSION...(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 257 AM EDT Thu May 25 2023

Very quiet weather pattern continues into next week as omega block
transitions to a rex block then quasi zonal flow regime with
little moisture transport available.

For today and tonight the surface high builds in and another
headline for frost or freezing temperatures may be needed for
roughly the northern half of the forecast area.

Dry soundings for the next few days plus dry ground will mean
large diurnal temperature ranges, on the order of 40 degrees F.
Moderation of airmass with warmer temperatures for the weekend
into next week. Still no measurable rain seen through the end of
the month.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 921 PM EDT Wed May 24 2023

Our frost advisory may not work out too well since the winds stay
up around 10-15 mph (with occasional higher gusts) for much of
the night and there is considerable high level cloudiness
streaming in from the northwest. Another big problem is the sfc
dew pt depressions are significant and even at 6 AM Thursday
morning still range from near 6F at MOP to as much as 16F at MKG
in HRRR guidance.

The best chance for any frost late tonight looks to be over
eastern sections (LAN/AMN/MOP) where lowest wind speeds and dew pt
depressions should occur after 06Z, with lesser chance over western
sections (GRR/MKG/LDM). It`s not really worth it at this point
to remove any counties from the frost headline, especially since
certain micro-climates could easily see the sfc winds die off and
temps plummet late at night. The freeze warning area looks fine,
especially if clouds end up being predominately thin.

.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 330 AM EDT Wed May 24 2023

Cold front moves through today with little moisture to work with.
Cut POPs that were limited to begin with across the northeast
forecast area. Strong cold advection this afternoon and evening on
northeast winds will result in overnight lows dropping to near or
below freezing across the northern interior and in the mid to
upper 30s across the rest of the forecast area.

We have issued a Freeze Warning for Lake, Osceola and Clare
Counties and a Frost Advisory for all but the southern tier.
Surface high remains across the Great Lakes region through the
rest of the week with moderating temperatures but another cold
night is expected with frost/freeze potential for Thursday night
as well.

Omega block develops then transitions to a rex block, keeping dry
weather in place through early next week. It may be early June
before the pattern yields a chance of measurable rain.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 1054 PM EDT Tue May 23 2023

Back door cold front timing is for an early Wednesday morning
fropa and a stark change to the currently calm/mild conditions.
Expecting a surge of cool northeast winds to sweep through around
12Z, with wind gusts to 30 mph at times on Wednesday behind the
front and temps only in the 60s. (May even stay stuck in the 50s
downwind of Saginaw Bay.) Precip chances are very low along the
front given all the dry air, with low chc pops for light showers
or sprinkles restricted to mainly just the Clare/Mt Pleasant
areas.

.DISCUSSION...(Today through next Monday)
Issued at 208 AM EDT Tue May 23 2023

Quiet weather patten continues. One more warm day before Canadian
high pressure builds in and brings cooler temperatures on
Wednesday. Added slight chance POPs to the northern forecast area
for early Wednesday as some light showers are possible in the
strong convergence along the cold front.

Frost and even some freezing temperatures possible Wednesday
night as surface ridging brings good radiational cooling
conditions. Cold hollows up north could drop into the upper 20s
but expect most places will be in the 30s. Frost/Freeze potential
will be monitored.

Blocking pattern, with omega block transitioning to a rex block
will keep Great Lakes region mostly dry into next week. Only
chance of rain will be later in the weekend if upper low that cuts
off across the central Appalachians meanders far enough north.

.DISCUSSION...(Today through next Sunday)
Issued at 300 AM EDT Mon May 22 2023

Two very low chances for rain this week, otherwise very quiet
weather to continue into the weekend. Slight chance POPS for the
northeast forecast area continues for this afternoon but soundings
show that moisture is quite limited. There is also limited
instability, so any rain should be light.

The other chance for rain would be along the strong cold front on
Wednesday morning. The moisture is deeper, but the front comes
through during the early morning, when instability is at the
diurnal low. We do not currently have POPS during this time but
may add them based on future model trends.

Canadian high pressure brings a cold Thursday morning and frost
and freezing temperatures might be an issue across the northern
forecast area. Temperatures moderate by the end of the week.

.DISCUSSION...(Today through next Saturday)
Issued at 316 AM EDT Sun May 21 2023

...Dry through Saturday...

High pressure currently centered over the Missouri Valley will drift
east this week and when combined with the northwest flow aloft will
result in dry weather and lots of sunshine, along with warmer
temperatures.

An upper trough exists over Hudson Bay and ECMWF/GFS show several
short waves rotating around it. We`ll see a cold front drop south
across Lower Michigan Wednesday. The moisture that is noted along
the front will likely remain over Ontario, but it`s possible that a
few showers could clip northeast Lower or the Thumb with an outside
chance of the far eastern cwa. Chances are too low to include any
precipitation in the grids for mid week.

The result of Wednesday`s cold front will be an increase in some
clouds, slightly cooler temperatures and a continued dry northeast
wind.

.DISCUSSION...(This evening through next Saturday)
Issued at 249 PM EDT Sat May 20 2023

-- Mainly dry and warm through the next week --

We are seeing the last vestiges of the upper low this afternoon that
brought rain to parts of the area yesterday, and the cloud cover
today. The upper low is in the process of rotating out of the area,
and skies should clear out entirely this evening.

We will see anticyclonic flow take control of the weather for the
region over the next few days through Wednesday. We will be out
ahead of a fairly decent amplitude upper ridge that will be centered
generally over the Plains. Being downstream of this ridge, we will
be under increasing subsidence that will provide the dry weather.

We will be on the edge of the subsidence, and just south of the jet
stream. We will see multiple waves ride north of us across Canada,
with the tail end shear zone barely clipping the state. These will
mostly be moisture starved, so most of the effects will be a few mid
and upper level clouds. We will see temperatures aloft warm each day
through Tuesday, allowing sfc temperatures to respond and do the
same thing, with highs mainly in the 70s.

We will see a bit stronger wave move by to our north on Wednesday,
and an associated stronger push of cooler air drop down as a result
in the form of a backdoor cold front. The models differed a bit on
this over the last 24 hours, but have come into pretty good
agreement in showing it now. This front will be moisture starved
also, but could be strong enough to squeeze out a sprinkle or two as
it drops in. This front will bring highs back into the 60s for Wed
and possibly Thursday with the Canadian air mass dropping in.

Once that wave moves through, the upper ridge will reestablish itself
to our west by Friday. This will reinforce our dry weather, and help
to warm temperatures back up again and even warmer for the upcoming
holiday weekend.
